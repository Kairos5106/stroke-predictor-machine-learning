    "# Team 44 Group Assignment: Stroke Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "A stroke can be defined as an interruption of blood flow to part of the brain that can cause critical damage to brain tissue. This will result in permanent loss of brain function within minutes if blood flow is not reestablished immediately such as a loss of motor functions and rational thought. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1 in 6 deaths from cardiovascular diseases was from strokes in the year 2020 in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, it is imperative that steps be taken to identify individuals who are at risk of getting a stroke to prevent permanent physiological damage to individuals of society.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this machine learning project, we, Team 44 of the WIA1006 Machine Learning course of University of Malaya would like to develop a machine learning model that predicts which individual(s) are at risk of getting a stroke. We will analyze a dataset of interest that will be used to train different machine learning models of which we will evaluate their respective accuracies and efficiencies."
